This task contains a few parts:
Write a custom function which returns your name or username.
Write a decorator which allows access for your user and prints “Permission denied” for other users.

Tips: 
Create `get_user_info` function which returns your name or username.
Create decorator which raises Exception if `get_user_info` returns not your name or username
Create `check_perms` function decorated by decorator. This function returns `Allowed access` if user validation is successful.
